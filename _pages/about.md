I am Reza Khayami, a dedicated researcher in the field of Human Genetics. I hold an MSc degree in Human Genetics from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, where I conducted research on genomics, genome editing, bioinformatics, and cancer.

I'm thrilled to share my extensive experience in delving into genomics data and harnessing the power of machine learning to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, identify crucial prognostic biomarkers, and forecast cancer outcomes with precision. But that's not all – my passion truly lies in propelling human genetics research forward through cutting-edge computational methods. I'm eager to continue making impactful strides in this dynamic field!
