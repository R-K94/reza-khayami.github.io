I am Reza Khayami, a dedicated researcher in the field of Human Genetics. I hold an MSc degree in Human Genetics from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, where I conducted research on genomics, genome editing, bioinformatics, and cancer.

I have experience analyzing genomics data and applying machine learning to it to enable earlier cancer diagnosis, find prognostic biomarkers and predict cancer outcome. I am also passionate about advancing human genetics research through computational methods.
