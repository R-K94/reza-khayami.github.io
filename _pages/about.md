I am Reza Khayami, a dedicated researcher in the field of Human Genetics. I hold an MSc degree in Human Genetics from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, where I conducted extensive research on genomics, genome editing, bioinformatics, and cancer.

I have experience applying machine learning to genomic data to enable earlier cancer diagnosis. I am passionate about advancing cancer research through computational methods. Outside of research, I enjoys creating graphics to communicate complex scientific concepts visually.


Research
======
My research interests span genomics, bioinformatics, and cancer. My past projects involved identifying methylation biomarkers for early gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis using machine learning. I has also conducted research applying machine learning to detect colorectal cancer early.

I have experience with techniques like RNA-seq, exome sequencing, Illumina methylation arrays, and network analysis. My work has contributed to successful student theses and research publications in reputable journals.
